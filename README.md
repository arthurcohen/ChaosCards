# Chaos Cards

A simple Android project, using Android Studio! 

Developed for the Mobile Systems Development class at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - BR.

## Getting Started

This project was inspired by the game [Wizard of Legend](http://wizardoflegend.com). Initially, it would be a turn based online coop game. The game would have magic types, and every type would have advantages and weaknesses from another. But my expectations were really high...

At the end, I got up with a online Jokenpo game. It resembles the original game, if you really try to believe hahaha!

It uses Realtime Database as a service from the [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) flexible solution for NoSQL database.

## Running

Sadly, to run this app, you will need to build the installer in the Android Studio. I will make it available in the Play Store in the future.
