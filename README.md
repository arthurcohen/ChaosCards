# Chaos Cards

A simple Android project, using Android Studio!

## Getting Started

This project was inspired by the game [Wizard of Legend](http://wizardoflegend.com). Initially, it would be a turn based online coop game. The game would have magic types, and every type would have advantages and weaknesses from another. But my expectations were really high...

At the end, I got up with a online Jokenpo game. It resembles the original game, if you really try to believe hahaha!

## Running

Sadly, to run this app, you will need to build the installer in the Android Studio. I will make it available in the Play Store in the future.
